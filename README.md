TaskMaster is a powerful, feature-rich RESTful API for managing to-do lists and tasks with robust user authentication, role-based permissions, and comprehensive task organization capabilities.

## ‚≠ê What Makes TaskMaster Different

Unlike standard to-do list applications, TaskMaster offers:

- **Enterprise-grade security** with JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and role-based access control
- **Multi-level organization** with lists and tasks hierarchy for better organization
- **Priority management system** with customizable priority levels
- **Advanced caching** with Redis for optimized performance and scalability
- **Admin dashboard capabilities** for team management and oversight
- **Comprehensive API** that can support multiple frontend clients (web, mobile, desktop)
- **Performance optimizations** with database connection pooling and proper indexing
- **Scalable architecture** with clustering support via PM2
- **Advanced filtering** for tasks based on due dates, completion status, and priorities
- **Bulk operations** for efficient task and list management
- **Advanced logging** with daily log rotation for better debugging and monitoring
- **Full HTTPS support** with custom SSL certificate configuration
- **Rate limiting** to prevent API abuse and ensure system stability
- **Separate development and production environments** with environment-specific configurations

## üß† Caching Strategy

TaskMaster implements a sophisticated Redis caching strategy:

### Cache Implementation

- **Cache-Aside Pattern**: Check cache first, fall back to database
- **Time-Based Expiration**: Configurable TTL for all cached items
- **Strategic Invalidation**: Smart cache clearing when data is modified
- **Hierarchical Key Structure**: Organized key naming scheme for efficient invalidation
- **Namespace Prefixing**: Prevents key collisions with other applications

### Key Generators

Structured naming convention for cache keys:

- `users:${userId}` - Single user data
- `users:${userId}:lists` - All lists for a user
- `users:${userId}:lists:${listId}` - Specific list data
- `users:${userId}:tasks` - All tasks for a user
- `priorities` - All priority levels

### Cache Operations

- Automatic cache invalidation on writes
- Pattern-based invalidation for related entities
- Error-resistant caching with graceful fallbacks
- Optional cache clearing on application startup

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js 5.x
- **Database**: MySQL 8+
- **Caching**: Redis 6+
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Security**: Helmet, bcrypt, rate-limiting
- **Logging**: Winston with daily rotation
- **Development**: Nodemon for hot-reloading

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MySQL (v8.0 or higher)
- Redis (v6.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TaskMaster.git
   cd TaskMaster
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables (use `.env-example` as a template)

4. Generate SSL certificates (if using HTTPS):

   ```bash
   npm run ssl:generate
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   # Development mode with hot reloading
   npm start

   # OR using PM2
   npm run pm2:dev
   ```
